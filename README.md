# web_apps_course

# This is a project formed loosely off of the concepts being learned from the Codecademy course "Building Web Apps with Python and Flask"

# Here I will include various projects completed in lessons, in order to learn the process of GitHub as well as create a log as a reminder of steps taken along the way.

# The first project is a furniture store receipt
